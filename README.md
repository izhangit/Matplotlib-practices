# Matplotlib

 ### Matplotlib is a powerful Python library for data visualization that provides a wide range of tools to create high-quality static, interactive, and animated plots and charts.

 # Line Plot

 - A basic plotting module in Matplotlib used to visualize data as a continuous line connecting data points, often used to display trends and patterns over time or a continuous range.

# Bar  Plot

- Another module in Matplotlib that represents data using rectangular bars of varying heights, commonly used to compare discrete categories or groups of data.

# Scatter Plot

- A plotting module in Matplotlib that displays individual data points as dots on a two-dimensional plane, ideal for showcasing the relationship between two variables and identifying potential correlations.

 # Histogram

 - Matplotlib's histogram module is used to visualize the distribution of a single variable by dividing data into bins and displaying the frequency or count of data points within each bin.

# Box Plot

 - Also known as a box-and-whisker plot, this Matplotlib module provides a concise summary of data distribution by showing the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in a visual format.

# Pie Chart

-  A circular chart in Matplotlib that represents the proportion of each category in a dataset as slices of a pie, providing an easy way to visualize relative proportions.

# Doughnut Chart

-  Similar to a pie chart, the doughnut chart in Matplotlib presents data in the form of a ring with a hole in the center, offering a more visually appealing alternative for displaying categorical proportions while retaining the same information.
